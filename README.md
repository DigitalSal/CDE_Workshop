# CDE_Workshop
The CDE Workshop introduces our partners to the features of CDE, the Data Engineering Data Service of the Cloudera Data Platform (CDP). During the course of this workshop,you will experience how simple it is to run and orchestrate spark jobs with the help of auto-scaling infrastructure. We will use Airflow for orchestrating the various jobs.
